Effective and efficient data can provide valuable insights for better decision-making, operational optimization, and overall business performance improvement. Minimarts, as small to medium-sized retail businesses, often face challenges in managing customer information, product inventory, operational efficiency, and more. The goal of this project is to conduct an analysis using minimart data with the expectation that the company can optimize operations, increase sales, and gain a competitive advantage.
